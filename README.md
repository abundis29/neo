# Neo Module

The Neo module is a utility library for building user interfaces in web applications. It provides a set of functions and components for creating UI elements in a structured manner.

## What is Neo?

Neo is designed to simplify the process of creating user interfaces (UI) in web applications. It offers a collection of functions and components that allow developers to easily create and manage UI elements. Whether you're building a single-page application, a web portal, or a complex web application, Neo can help streamline your UI development.

## Installation

You can install the Neo module using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install neo-module
or

yarn add neo-module
Usage
To use the Neo module in your project, import the necessary functions and components as needed. Here's an example of how to import and use some of the core features:

const { renderApp, vStack, hStack, text, button, input, image, breadcrumb } = require('neo-module');

// Create UI components
const myStack = vStack({ spacing: 10 }, [
  text('Hello, Neo!'),
  button('Click me', () => console.log('Button clicked')),
  input({ placeholder: 'Enter text' }),
]);

// Render the UI
const container = document.getElementById('root');
renderApp(() => ({ elements: [myStack] }), container);
